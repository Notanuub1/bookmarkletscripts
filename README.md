# bookmarkletscripts  
a bunch of crap scripts I've made because my site got taken down  
  
if running without console, add `javascript:` ahead of it, and bookmark it.  
  
add an issue if you find an issue, create a pull request if you have more scripts to add, i'll give credit

closes popupbrowser when run
